# Bike Rewards App
Cycle was designed as a rewards based application that users would enter the distance they rode(in KM) and this distance was
converted into points. These points could then be spent on rewards. This application was a design project in my first year engineering
at UVic. The goal of this project was to present a solution to incentive people to use other modes of transportation such as biking,
busing, carpooling, and so on.

# Things I learned 

* Basic Swift Syntax
* Creating a points system
* Using Firebase for registering users and login
* Basic GUI design
* Creating a post feed
* Using code and Xcode stroyboard to navigate to different screens

NOTE: The login, registration, and post feed will not work as I have unlinked Firebase. You can still login in just by
clicking the login button without having to enter a username or password.
